# Fingernail Segmentation
**Using a U-Net segmentation model for partioning out fingernails from images**<br>
_Deployed using the Django Rest Framework_


## What it does?
The project basically makes use of a U-net segmentation model to identify and segment out portions of pixels containing fingernails from a given input image.

The partioned portion can be used for further processing and analysis.
<br><br>
The model itself has been deployed using the Django Rest Framework API and can be used to make predictions on the go!

## Technologies used
1. Python 
2. Django 
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras
5. Jupyter Notebook (for model training and visualisation)
6. Matplotlib (for visualisation)
